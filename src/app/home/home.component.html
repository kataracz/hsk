  <p>Here you can practice the hardest part of an HSK exam: the characters. Take a look at the flashcards that help you memorize characters and their translations,
  and check out the quiz, it's fun. Choose which level you're learning, or save words that you feel like you have to practice a bit more.</p><br>

    Good Luck!
